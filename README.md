# Aksharyogini Marathi Normal
This repository contains my modifications to the "Aksharyogini2" font for fixing some issues with it. The original font was published in 2013 by Sudhanwa Jogalekar in the reminiscence of the Late Yogini Jogalekar, one of the greatest authors, poets and classical music artists of the Marathi Rangabhumi.

### My modifications include :
- Alteration of the "Devanagari Chandra A" (à¥²) character to correct the malformed outline.
- Removal of the Latin-1 Suppliment block due to it's buggy implementation.

### License
The font was originally licensed under SIL OFL 1.1. My new modified font "AksharyoginiMarathi" is also licensed under this same license.
